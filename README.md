## [Kaggle - Software Defect Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e23/overview)

This repo is based on my submission to the Software Defect Prediction competition, where I achieved 1st place among 1704 participants.
It was a binary classification task and the goal was to predict defects in C programs based on various attributes of the code. Submissions were evaluated based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC) comparing the predicted probabilities to the observed targets.
